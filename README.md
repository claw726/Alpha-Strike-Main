## Alpha-Strike-Main

This project is the main user interface for the Alpha-Strike Killboard, a leaderboard for the game Eve Frontier. It allows users to view recent activities, top-ranking players and systems, and search for specific killmails. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, and it is now bundled using Vite. The live website can be found at [https://www.alpha-strike.space/](https://www.alpha-strike.space/) and utilizes the API at [https://api.alpha-strike.space/](https://api.alpha-strike.space/) for data.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: (LTS version recommended)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager) or **yarn**

---

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd alpha-strike-main
    ```

---

## Installation

1.  **Install project dependencies**:
    Open your terminal in the project's root directory and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or if you prefer yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```
    This will install Vite and other necessary development dependencies listed in `package.json`.

---

## Running Locally (Development)

1.  **Start the development server**:
    To run the project locally with Vite's development server, which includes features like Hot Module Replacement (HMR), execute:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    or with yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
    This command is defined in the `scripts` section of your `package.json`.
2.  Open your browser and navigate to the local URL provided by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173` or similar).

---

## Building for Production

1.  **Build the project**:
    To create an optimized build for production, run:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    or with yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```
    This command, also found in `package.json`, will use Vite to bundle your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The output will be placed in a `dist/` directory by default. The `vite.config.js` file specifies the input HTML files for the build process.

---

## Previewing Production Build

1.  **Preview the production build locally**:
    After building the project, you can preview the production version by running:
    ```bash
    npm run preview
    ```
    or with yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn preview
    ```
    This command starts a local static web server that serves the files from your `dist/` directory.
